It has been a long time coming. I have delayed it and procrastinate around it for a few months, but I finally finished it with 100% completion. The journey for me started on the 12th of May 2020 and finished yesterday, the 7th May 2021.

Sal and his team truly deserve the most generous praise and all the donations we can spare, because this is a remarkable project, and the lessons are concise and the explanations easy to follow.

There are a few projects that stand out for me. The criteria is that they should not be motivated by money, but by the desire to improve the whole world, even a little bit. Big idea and great ambition, to be sure, but also, as Sal proved it, entirely possible.

The three projects that have a special place in my heart and I use quite frequently are <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.khanacademy.org" target="_blank">Khan Academy</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.wikipedia.org/" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp</a>.

Thank you Khan Academy for all the hard work you put into the project and for changing the understanding of maths for this old surgeon.
